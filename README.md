## Unit Test and Coverage

## Ex1 : Verlan
Implement a function named "verlan" that takes a string as input and returns a new string
with the following modifications:
- Remove leading and trailing whitespaces.
- Reverse the order of characters in the string.
- Convert all characters to lowercase.

For example:
input: "  Hello World  "
output: "dlrow olleh"

## Ex2 : Calculator
 Perform basic arithmetic operations based on the given operation.

Parameters:
  - a: The first operand (number)
  - b: The second operand (number)
  - operation: The arithmetic operation to perform ('+', '-', '*', '/')

Returns:
  The result of the specified arithmetic operation.
  If the operation is not one of '+', '-', '*', '/', returns None.
  If attempting to divide by zero, returns None.

For example:
